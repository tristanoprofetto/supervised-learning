# Building Supervised-Learning Algorithms
Supervised Learning is a class of Machine Learning algorithms which have a defined response/target variable. This set of alorithms is best suited to leverage labeled data in order to build statistical models for Regression and Classification problems.

* Classification problems imply that the response (target) variable being predicted is **Categorical**

* Regression problems implies a predicted response which is **Numeric**

Implementations for the respective models are applied in both **Python** (JupyterNB) and **R**...
